ABalytics.js: pure js + Google Analytics A/B testing
====================================================================

This pure javascript library allows you to do simple A/B testing working only on your client-side code. All data is registered as custom variables in your website Google Analytics profile, so **you don't need to configure anything server side**.

Features
--------

*  Easy to set up
   * You just list the possible variants, the randomization is handled automatically
   * You just mark the html elements you want to test on with a class, the substitution is automatic
   * No need to set anything up server side, the data is stored on Google Analytics
* Consistent user experience: The selected variant is stored in a cookie, so the user will see the same one when coming back
* No external dependencies: Pure javascript, you just need to include GA
* Flexible: You can conduct multiple, independent experiments at the same time. Each experiment will use a custom variable slot

Usage
-----

### 1. Include abalytics.js
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="abalytics.js"></script>
```
### 2. Define your tests and configure GA
```javascript
var _gaq = _gaq || [];
      _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-XX']);
      _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

      _gaq = _gaq.concat(ABalytics.init({
        experiment1_name: [
          {
            name: 'variant1_name',
            "experiment1_class1_name": "<strong>Html content for variant 1 class 1</strong>",
            "experiment1_class2_name": "Html content for variant 1 class 2"
          },
          {
            name: 'variant2_name',
            "experiment1_class1_name": "<strong>Html content for variant 2 class 1</strong>",
            "experiment1_class2_name": "Html content for variant 2 class 2"
          }
        ],
        experiment2_name: [ ...
      }));
```
### 3. Apply the experiment classes to your html content
```html
<div class="experiment1_class1_name">
  This content will be replaced by ABalytics
</div>

<span class="experiment1_class2_name">This text will be replaced too</span>
```

### 4. If you have jQuery, call applyHtml() on when the document is ready! (recommended)

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  $(function () {
    ABalytics.applyHtml();
  });
</script>
```

### 4.2 If you don't have jQuery; call applyHtml() on load

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.onload = function() {
    ABalytics.applyHtml();
  };
</script>
```

Note: Waiting for onload might cause your variants to perform more poorly from the [FOUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) type flicker your user will experience.

### 5. Run your experiment

Publish your code, wait for some visitors to come...

### 6. Analyze your data

ABalytics works best if you defined some goals on Google Analytics.

In GA, go to Audience->Custom->Custom Variables. You will find your experiements names in the available slots.

Click on the experiment name you want to analyze to see how many visits where recorded for each variant. Then click on "Goal set 1" to see the goal conversion rate for each variant. Simple and easy!

Advanced options
----------------

If you are already using some custom variables, you can have ABalytics start from a slot > 1 using
```javascript
ABalytics.init({...}, YOUR_FIRST_FREE_SLOT);
```
